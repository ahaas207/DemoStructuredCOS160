COS 160 : Program 1 - Character Face  

=======================================

Objectives

Learning to use Eclipse to write and run your first program.  

General instructions for all assignments  

For each assignment you will write a Java program and test it. Start your programs with a comment block such as:

**/\*  
  NAME: <your name>  
  COS 160, Fall 2016, Prof. xxxxx, <Class day & time>   
  Program #1  
  File Name: Face.java  
\*/**

Your programs should be neatly formatted, and follow the indenting, formatting, spacing and commenting practices taught in class.  

You should hand in printed copies of both your program and its output. We suggest that you just copy and paste each part of the assignment into a single document in a word processor. Within Eclipse you can highlight and copy code from the code panel, and you can copy the output from the Console tab.  

Read each assignment carefully to see what is required. If you do not understand something in the assignment, ask a tutor or the instructor. You will get partial credit if you finish only part of an assignment or it isn't working correctly. Turn it in and explain what you completed and what issues it has. It is usually better to turn in an imperfect assignment on the due date, rather than falling behind in the course.  

Program 1 (30 points) Printing a Face with Characters  

![Face made of characters](https://www.cs.usm.maine.edu/~boothe/cos160/programs/Program1_files/face.png)

Write a program to print the face on the left out of characters. Your program should have 6 System.out.println(...) statements.

Even for programs as simple as this it helps to write and test your programs in small steps. Start with just the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th line and test that first. Note that the eyebrows are underscore characters.  

The 1st line for the hair uses double quotes. To include those in a string you must precede each with a backslash character like: \\"

The last 2 lines for the chin use backslashes and forward slashes. The backslashes will also need to be preceded with a second backslash like: \\\\

Extra Creativity Credit (5 points) Another Face

We want to encourage you to have fun in this class. Write a second program that makes a face of your own design. It should be something unique that you design. We suggest starting with some graph paper and thinking about the characters that are available and what you can do with them.  

What to turn in

Turn in your program(s) and their output(s). When you cut and paste your code or output into a word processor it may look distorted if it uses a non fixed width font.  If that happens to you, select your pasted text and change the font into a fixed width font such as Courier.  It is your responsibility to make your code and output neat and readable.
