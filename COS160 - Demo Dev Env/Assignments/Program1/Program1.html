<div class="headingB">General instructions for all assignments<br>
</div>
<p> For each
assignment you will write a Java program and test it. Start your
programs with a comment block such as: </p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;" align="left"><big><b>/* <br>
&nbsp; NAME: &lt;your name&gt; <br>
&nbsp; COS 160, Fall 2016, Prof. xxxxx, &lt;Class day &amp;
time&gt;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; Program #1 <br>
&nbsp; File Name: Face.java <br>
*/ </b> </big></p>
<p>Your
programs should be neatly formatted, and follow the indenting,
formatting, spacing and commenting practices taught in class.<br>
</p>
<p>You should hand in printed copies
of both your program and its output. We suggest that you
just copy and paste each part of the assignment into a single document
in a word processor. Within Eclipse
you can highlight and copy code from the code panel, and you can copy
the output from the Console tab.<br>
</p>
<p>Read each assignment carefully
to see what is required. If you do not understand something in the
assignment, ask a tutor or the instructor. You will get partial credit
if you finish only part of an assignment or it isn't working correctly.
Turn it in and explain what you completed and what issues it has. It is
usually better to turn in an imperfect assignment on the due date,
rather than falling behind in the course.<br>

<div class="headingB">Extra Creativity Credit (5 points) Another Face</div>
<p>We want to encourage you to have fun in
this class. Write a second program that
makes a face of your own design. It should
be something unique that you design. We
suggest starting with some graph paper and thinking about the
characters that are available and what you can do with them.<br>
</p>
<div class="headingB">What to turn in</div>
<p>Turn in your program(s) and their
output(s). When you cut and paste your code or output into a word
processor it may look distorted if it uses a non fixed width
font.&nbsp; If that happens to you, select your pasted text and change
the font into a fixed width font such as Courier.&nbsp; It is your
responsibility to make your code and output neat and readable.<br>
