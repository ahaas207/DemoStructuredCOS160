            something that we do without thinking much about it. For
            example, the change for 58 cents is 2 quarters, one nickel,
            and three pennies.&nbsp; In this lab, you will write a
            program to calculate the coins for an amount of money less
            than one dollar (expressed in cents). Of course, there are
            different ways to make change. Our change for 58 cents could
            consist of 58 pennies or we could use 5 dimes and 8 pennies,
            or ... What we would really like to do is use a minimal
            number of coins. <br>

            -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">For this lab, you will
            develop a greedy solution for calculating change. A greedy
            solution for making change is quite simple. Assume you want
            to convert an arbitrary number of cents into coins of the
            following denominations: quarter, dime, nickel, and penny.
            Use as many quarter coins as possible; then, on what's left
            over, use as many dime coins as possible; then on the left
            over, use as many nickels as possible; finally the remainder
            is in pennies.<br>

          </div>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We start by writing a program to ask the user for a number
            between 0 and 99 that represents the number of cents.</p>
          <p>Create a new Java Class for your program. I called mine <u><b>ChangeUS</b></u><br>
          </p>
          <p>When finished it will work like this:<br>
          </p>
          <div class="codenote"> Please enter the amount of change to be
            returned (a number between 0 &amp; 99): <b>58</b><br>
            The change for 58 cents is: <br>
          </div>
          <p> Use <b>System.out.print()</b> to display the prompt. Use
            a <b>Scanner</b> to read the user's input into your
            program. And then use <b>System.out.println()</b> to
            display a message showing the amount that the user typed
            in.&nbsp; (See zybooks section 1.2 if you need help.) </p>
          <p>Run your program. You will need to click on the Console
            panel to enter your input value. Fix any problems.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Proper code indentation in not required by Java, but it is
            essential in writing legible programs. Just like the line
            breaks in poetry help us to understand the structure of a
            poem, proper program indention help the reader quickly see
            its structure. Eclipse helps you maintain proper indentation
            automatically. Sometimes, however, the indentation gets off,
            such as when you cut and paste sections of code.&nbsp; The
            shortcut key (Windows:<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;

              Ctrl+I</span>&nbsp; , macs: <b>Cmd+I</b>) will correct
            the indentation for the current line, or if you select a
            block of code, it will correct the whole block. You can
            select and then indent the entire program with (Windows: <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl-A&nbsp; Ctrl-I </span>,
            macs: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cmd-A&nbsp; Cmd-I</span>).
            This is also on the pulldown menu: Source -&gt; Correct
            Indentation. Try it out.&nbsp; All code that you turn in for
            the exercises and programs should always be properly
            indented. </p>

          <p>You are now going to make a similar program that works with
            Euro's. Start by making a copy of your program as a starting
            point. In the "Package Explorer" panel on the left side of
            Eclipse (expand folders if needed) right-click on your
            ChangeUS.java file. Then paste is right back (Windows:
            Ctrl-V , Macs: Cmd-V). It asks for a new name. I used: <u>ChangeEuros</u></p>
          <p>In 1999, the European Union introduced a currency called
            the Euro which consists of eight coin denominations : <span

                replaced their national currency with the common EU
                currency (<a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_coins">Wikipedia</a>).





                A single shared currency among many countries is an
                interesting experiment that is still very much a work in
                progress.</span></span></p>
          <p> Now, write a program that calculates change in Euros for
            an amount less than 500 Euro cents. The interaction should
            look something like:</p>
          <div class="codenote"> Please enter the amount of change in
            euro cents to be returned (a number between 0 &amp; 499): <b>328</b><br>
            The change for 328 euro cents is: <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 €2<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 €1<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 €0.50<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 €0.20<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 €0.10<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 €0.05<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 €0.02<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 €0.01<br>
          </div>
          <p> You may be interested to know how to make that interesting
            Euro symbol. The following will print out the first line of
            change in the above example. <br>
          </p>
          <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(1
            + "&nbsp; \u20ac" +"2");</p>
          <p> The \u is telling println to treat the 20ac as a unicode
            character, Unicode supports the representation of many
            different charaters and languages. Just using a capital E
            will also be accepted. </p>
