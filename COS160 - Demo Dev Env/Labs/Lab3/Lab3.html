          <p> In this lab you will work with a few of the basic graphics
            programming methods of the Graphics2D class in the Java
            Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT). <br>

              <a href="Lab3_files/BoxGuy.java">BoxGuy.java</a> into your
              lab3 project folder.&nbsp; To copy files, right click on
              the link and save the file to the desktop. After saving to
              the desktop you can drag it into the lab3 project.
              Alternatively, just clicking on the link, highlighting the
              entire text and copying the program (Ctrl-c or command-c
              on Macs). &nbsp;Then just paste it into your lab3 project
              by right clicking on the lab3 project and pasting (Ctrl-v
              or command-v on Macs)&nbsp;&nbsp; (If the word "snippet"
              arises at any time, you did it wrong ... delete that and
              try again)</li>

          <p>Run the BoxGuy program to make sure it works. This program
            illustrates a few of the functions available in the
            Graphics2D class. Programs using the Drawing Panel stay
            running until you close the pop up Drawing Panel window, so
            try to remember to close the Drawing Panel each time before
            running your program again.&nbsp; It will get confusing if
            you leave several versions of your program running. Basic
            documentation about the DrawingPanel and Graphics2D class
            can be found at: <a
href="http://www.cs.usm.maine.edu/%7Eboothe/cos160/UsingJavaGraphics.pdf">http://www.cs.usm.maine.edu/~boothe/cos160/UsingJavaGraphics.pdf</a>
            and Comprehensive documentation about Graphics2D can be
            found at : <a
href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/awt/Graphics2D.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/awt/Graphics2D.html</a>
          </p>
          <p>Look over the BoxGuy program and make sure you understand
            it. You are going to be making a few small changes. Below
            are the changes that you need to make. Make each change one
            at a time and test it and make sure you understand it before
            moving on.<br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Change the background color<br>
            </li>
            <li>Change the eyes to white</li>
            <li>Add small round black pupils to the eyes<br>
            </li>
            <li>Change the word the box guy says</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Screen capture your final drawing panel and paste it into
            your solutions document.&nbsp; </p>
          <p> On a Mac, </p>
          <ul>
            <li>command-shift-4 key initiates the capture</li>
            <li>click on one corner of the image and drag to the other
              diagonal corner. <br>
            </li>
            <li>You will likely find the file with the image on the
              desktop. <br>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p> In Windows this can be done by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Selecting the window you want to capture.</li>
            <li>Hit <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alt-PrintScreen </span>to









              capture an image of your window to the clipboard.</li>
            <li>Switch into your editor and paste it with <span
                style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl-V</span>.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
          </ul>
          <p>Also paste your<span style="font-weight: bold;"> final
              program</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>into
your









            solutions document. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <div class="headingB">Exercise 2: (3 points) </div>
          <p>We take inspiration from the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser">Pyramid








              of Djoser</a> (a few artist liberties) to motivate us to
            produce an image that looks like : <br>
          </p>
          <blockquote> <img alt="Step Pyramid"
              src="./Lab3_files/StepPyramid.png" width="357"
              height="302"> </blockquote>
          <p><br>
            Create a new Java class called StepPyramid in your lab3
            project and, using the example code from step 1 as a guide,
            develop a Java program that produces an image similar to the
            above (you can exercise a few artistic liberties of your
            own). <br>
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Create a screen capture and put it in your solutions
            document and include your code as well. </p>
          <div class="headingB">Exercise 3: (3 points) </div>
          <p>Make a copy of the StepPyramid code. Right click on the
            StepPyramid.java file and select the copy option. Next,
            right click on the default package and select paste. It will
            ask for a new name and you should type RedSnowMan. Modify
            the RedSnowMan code to produce : </p>
          <blockquote> &nbsp;<img alt="Red SnowMan"
              src="./Lab3_files/Red%20SnowMan.png" width="367"
              height="308"> </blockquote>
          <p>Include a screen snapshot in your solutions document (code
            not necessary)<br>
          </p>
          <div class="headingB">Exercise 4: Extra Credit (2 points) </div>
          <p>Successive drawing calls to the same region will overwrite
            earlier pixels. We can use this to create some interesting
            effects. Create a new Java class called Rings and write code
            that creates an image that looks like:<br>
          </p>
          <p><img alt="Rings" src="./Lab3_files/Rings.png" width="358"
              height="412"> </p>
          <p> Note the black edges around each of the rings. To have the
            colors change from a deep red to darker reds, you will need
            to create a new Color object. There is an example of
            creating and using Color objects in the
            DrawShapesAndText.java code. For this case, we will start
            with Red at 255 (max) and decrease it by about 50 units each
            time we create a smaller ring. </p>
          <p>Include a screen snapshot and code in the solutions
            document. </p>
