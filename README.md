# DemoStructuredCOS160 - A Configuration-as-code introductory development environment. 

Welcome to the DemoStructuredCOS160 repository! This repository contains the code and files to demonstrate a configuration-as-code approach to intro to a computer science level course development environment (this example uses real course material from the intro course at the University of Southern Maine). 

## Make sure you're signed up for GitHub. (If from USM, be sure to sign up using your Maine.edu email for extra hours of free tier Codespaces.)

## Getting Started

To get started with this demo, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Repository**: Click on the "Use this template" button at the top of the repository page to create a new repository based on this template. Provide your repository's name and click "Create repository from template."

2. **Open Codespaces**: Once your repository is created, navigate to the repository's main page. Click on the "Code" button and select "Create Codespace on Main" to launch the Codespaces web-based development environment.

3. **Access the Codespace**: Codespaces will set up the development environment based on the configurations specified in the repository. Once the setup is complete, you will be automatically connected to the Codespace.

4. **Explore the Files**: Inside the Codespace, you will find various files related to the structured approach to COS160. Take a look at the code samples, documentation, and other resources provided.
