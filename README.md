# DemoStructuredCOS160
# Configuration-as-code introductory development environment. 

This repository demonstrates a configuration-as-code approach for an introductory to computer science student development environment.
This example uses real course activity and homework material from the University of Southern Maine Computer Science intro course, CS160. 

## Make sure you're signed up for GitHub. (If from USM, be sure to sign up using your Maine.edu email for extra hours of free tier Codespaces.)

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Repository**: Click on the "Use this template" button at the top of the repository page to create a new repository based on this template. Provide your repository's name and click "Create repository from template."

2. **Open Codespaces**: Once your repository is created, navigate to the repository's main page. Click on the "Code" button and select "Create Codespace on Main" to launch the Codespaces web-based development environment.

3. **Access the Codespace**: Codespaces will set up the development environment based on the configurations specified in the repository. Once the setup is complete, you will be automatically connected to the Codespace.

4. **Explore the Files**: Inside the Codespace, you will find various files related to the structured approach to COS160. Take a look at the code samples, documentation, and other resources provided.
